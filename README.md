# Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy is a service sits between the client and backend servers. The proxy server takes and directs client requests to the appropriate backend servers. A proxy server can also perform additional tasks such as SSL encryption, caching, compression and load balancing to take the load off the backend servers.

## Let's get started
We are going to create another Dockerfile that will contain an Apache web server which will rely on the use of [ProxyPass Directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html). To keep with the theme from the previous lab we will use the same domain names `site1.internal`, `site2.internal` and `site3.internal`

1. Update `site1.internal` vHost using `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` directives so that any request for `/` is sent `site2.internal`. This means that when you make a request to `site1.internal` it will serve the page located in `site2.internal`  

2. Update `site1.internal` vHost by using another Proxy directive to proxy any request made for `site1.internal/special` so that it sends the request to `site3.internal`.

3. Make sure to force HTTPS as we did in the previous lab. If a user enters `http://site1.internal` it should rewrite the url `https://site1.internal`.

4. Create an `images` directory in `/home` directory and COPY 3 image files into the `/home/images` directory. 

5. Update `site1.internal` vHost to serve your images from the `/home/images` directory. For example if a request comes in for `https://site1.internal/images/my_image.jpg` the file `my_image.jpg` will be served from `/home/images`

## Submission
Your submission should include the following:
 - Dockerfile
 - vHost Configuration file(s)
 - 3 image files
 - index.html file(s)

Note: be sure to include any additional files used. i.e. if you use the COPY statement in your Dockerfile be sure the file you are copying is committed to the repo.
